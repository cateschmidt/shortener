# shortener
URL shortener using RUST
# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Rust language.}

I created a URL shortener that takes a long URL and shortens it, then redirects it to the homepage of that website. If the URL does not exist, it will redirect the user to a 404 page that says URL doesn't exist.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

I created this software to provide an easy to use user friendly URL shortener that anyone could use.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}

I used VS code, my laptop, as well as some online forums for troubleshooting my code.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used Rust and serde to create this program.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I would like to eventually host this program on a server and have it be something the public could use online, rather than the command line program that it currently is.
- I would like to make this more involved to where the user could shorten multiple URL's at once.
- In the future, I would also like to create a login/logout functionality so you could access your URL's based on if you're logged in or not.
